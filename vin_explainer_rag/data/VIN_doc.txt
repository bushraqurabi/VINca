Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) Guide

What is a VIN?
A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a unique 17-character alphanumeric code that acts like a vehicle’s fingerprint. It encodes important information about the vehicle, including:

Manufacturer

Specifications

Production details

Where to Find a VIN
You can locate the VIN in several places, such as:

On the dashboard (driver’s side), visible through the windshield

Driver’s side door frame or pillar

Vehicle registration papers

Insurance documents

Title certificate

How VIN Decoding Works
VIN decoders interpret each character or group of characters according to standardized rules defined by:

ISO 3779 — International VIN format specification

NHTSA — U.S. regulations on vehicle identification

Each segment of the VIN corresponds to specific data about the vehicle.

Key VIN Components
Characters	Section Name	Description
1–3	World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI)	Identifies the vehicle’s manufacturer and country of origin
4–8	Vehicle Description Section (VDS)	Details the vehicle model, body style, engine type, and features
9	Check Digit	Validates the VIN using a standardized checksum calculation
10	Model Year	Indicates the vehicle’s manufacturing year
11	Plant Code	Identifies the assembly plant
12–17	Serial Number	Unique serial number assigned to the individual vehicle

VIN Length: Standard VINs always consist of 17 characters.

WMI (Characters 1-3): The first three characters represent the World Manufacturer Identifier, revealing the vehicle’s manufacturer and origin.

VDS (Characters 4-8): This segment provides specifics such as model, body style, engine type, and other key features.

Check Digit (Character 9): Used to ensure the VIN’s authenticity through a mathematical verification.

Model Year (Character 10): Encodes the production year of the vehicle.

Plant Code (Character 11): Indicates the manufacturing plant where the vehicle was assembled.

Serial Number (Characters 12-17): A unique number that differentiates each vehicle made by the manufacturer.

VIN Structure:

Character 1: Country of origin
Character 2: Manufacturer
Character 3: Vehicle type or manufacturing division
Characters 4-8: Vehicle attributes (model, body type, engine)
Character 9: Check digit (validates VIN authenticity)
Character 10: Model year (e.g., A=1980, B=1981, ... Y=2000, 1=2001, etc.)
Character 11: Assembly plant
Characters 12-17: Serial number unique to the vehicle

Example: VIN 1HGCM82633A004352
- 1 = USA (country)
- H = Honda (manufacturer)
- G = Passenger car
- C M 8 2 = Model details
- 6 = Check digit
- 3 = 2003 (model year)
- 3 = Plant code
- 004352 = Serial number


A VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a unique 17-character code assigned to every motor vehicle when it's manufactured. 
It contains info like manufacturer, model year, engine type, and more.

VINs don't use letters I, O, or Q to avoid confusion with numbers.
The 10th character of a VIN tells the model year of the vehicle.
